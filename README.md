# Temperature Tracker

## The task

Write code to continually track the max, min, and avg temperature as new numbers are inserted into a tracker class.
Write a class TempTracker with these methods:

- A method to insert a new temperature.
- A method to get the highest temperature we’ve seen so far.
- A method to get the lowest temperature we’ve seen so far.
- A method to get the average of all temps we've seen so far.
- Optimise for space and time. Favour speeding up the getters over the setters.
- The code should be written in JavaScript.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Run `npm i` in the project directory to install dependencies.

## Test

You can run default test cases by:

```bash
npm test
```

Or you can add your custom test cases to `./test/main.spec.js`.
